Using asyoulikeit in your CLI
=============================

``asyoulikeit`` is a small library you apply to a Click-based
command-line tool to give your handlers a single source of truth for
structured output. Instead of printing in one hard-coded format, your
handler returns a :class:`~asyoulikeit.Reports` value and the library
handles rendering it as JSON, TSV, or a rich human-readable display,
according to whatever the user selected with the ``--as`` flag.

This page walks through the typical shape of an integration. See
:doc:`cli` for what your users will see on the command line, and
:doc:`api` for the full API reference.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install asyoulikeit

Or with uv:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv add asyoulikeit


The minimal example
-------------------

A Click command decorated with :func:`~asyoulikeit.report_output`
returns a :class:`~asyoulikeit.Reports` value. That's essentially all
there is to it.

.. code-block:: python

   import click
   from asyoulikeit import Report, Reports, TableContent, report_output


   @click.command()
   @report_output
   def list_users():
       """List the users of the system."""
       data = (
           TableContent(title="Users")
           .add_column("name", "Name")
           .add_column("role", "Role")
           .add_row(name="Alice", role="admin")
           .add_row(name="Bob", role="user")
       )
       return Reports(users=Report(data=data))


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       list_users()

Run ``list_users`` attached to a terminal and it renders with the
``display`` formatter — borders, a title, legible rows. Pipe the output
into another program and it renders as TSV (``# Name\tRole`` header
then tab-separated values). Pass ``--as json`` and it emits structured
JSON. The handler is identical across all three modes; the choice of
format is a runtime concern the decorator handles.


The data model
--------------

Three classes carry all the state.

:class:`~asyoulikeit.TableContent` is a schema-validated table builder.
Add columns first, then rows. Every row must supply exactly the columns
that were declared — missing keys and unexpected keys both raise
:exc:`ValueError`, which catches typos early. ``TableContent`` also
holds optional ``title`` and ``description`` metadata that some
formatters display.

:class:`~asyoulikeit.TreeContent` is the hierarchical sibling — a
forest of nodes sharing a single column schema. See :ref:`tree-content`
below.

Both ``TableContent`` and ``TreeContent`` are implementations of
:class:`~asyoulikeit.ReportContent`. Future shapes (heterogeneous
trees, lists, description lists, …) will slot in as further subclasses
without changing the rest of the API.

:class:`~asyoulikeit.Report` is a frozen dataclass wrapping one piece
of ``ReportContent`` plus formatting preferences (``detail_level``,
``header``). These preferences are *suggestions* — the user can
override them from the command line.

:class:`~asyoulikeit.Reports` is a validated mapping of
``name → Report``. A command can return a single named report or
several; both are expressed by the same type. The names become keys in
JSON output and selectors for the user's ``--report`` flag.


Importance and detail level
---------------------------

Not every column is equally important. Some carry core identifying
information ("name", "id", "status"); others are supplementary
("notes", "last modified", "description"). Tag this with
:class:`~asyoulikeit.Importance` on columns, and if needed on
individual rows:

.. code-block:: python

   from asyoulikeit import Importance

   data = (
       TableContent()
       .add_column("name", "Name")                                    # ESSENTIAL (the default)
       .add_column("notes", "Notes", importance=Importance.DETAIL)
       .add_row(name="Alice", notes="Joined 2024-03")                 # essential row (the default)
       .add_row(name="Bob",   notes="Deprecated",
                _importance=Importance.DETAIL)
   )

When the user passes ``--essential``, DETAIL columns and DETAIL rows
drop out. When they pass ``--detailed``, everything stays. The default
is ``AUTO``, which each formatter resolves to whatever makes sense for
itself: TSV picks ``ESSENTIAL`` (pipe-friendly), JSON and display pick
``DETAILED`` (self-describing or human-facing).


Multiple reports
----------------

A single command can return more than one report. All reports are
rendered by default; the user narrows with ``--report <name>``, or
passes ``--report`` multiple times.

.. code-block:: python

   return Reports(
       users=Report(data=users_data),
       roles=Report(data=roles_data),
   )

Use ``@report_output(default_reports=None)`` to make a command
silent by default — useful for action commands that should produce no
visible output unless the user asks for a specific report. Use
``@report_output(default_reports=["users"])`` to show only a
specific subset by default.


.. _tree-content:

Tree content
------------

When your data is hierarchical — a filesystem subtree, an organisation
chart, a syntax tree — return :class:`~asyoulikeit.TreeContent` from
your handler instead of ``TableContent``. The API is deliberately
parallel: you declare a column schema just like for a table, but every
*node* in the tree carries values matching that schema (homogeneous
columns across all nodes) and nodes form a parent/child hierarchy
instead of a flat list.

.. code-block:: python

   from asyoulikeit import (
       Importance, Report, Reports, TreeContent, report_output,
   )

   @click.command()
   @report_output
   def list_usr():
       tree = (
           TreeContent(title="/usr")
           .add_column("name", "Name", header=True)
           .add_column("size", "Size")
           .add_column("kind", "Kind", importance=Importance.DETAIL)
       )
       usr = tree.add_root(name="/usr", size=0, kind="dir")
       bin_dir = usr.add_child(name="bin", size=4096, kind="dir")
       bin_dir.add_child(name="ls", size=150_296, kind="exec")
       bin_dir.add_child(name="cat", size=52_024, kind="exec")
       return Reports(fs=Report(data=tree))

Key differences from ``TableContent``:

* **Exactly one column must be marked** ``header=True``. Trees always
  need a label for each node; that label is what the display formatter
  draws alongside the ASCII-art connectors.
* **Repeatable roots.** ``add_root`` may be called once for a single
  tree, or many times to build a forest — useful when listing several
  independent top-level items.
* **Return the child, not the parent.** ``Node.add_child(...)`` hands
  back the newly-added child, so you descend by keeping a reference
  to each level you need. Siblings come from calling ``add_child`` on
  the shared parent again.
* **Per-node** :class:`~asyoulikeit.Importance` **tagging prunes whole
  subtrees**. A node marked ``DETAIL`` and *all its descendants* drop
  out under ``--essential``, because you cannot show a child while
  hiding its parent.

The three built-in formatters each render trees in the way best suited
to their audience:

* ``display`` lays ASCII-art connectors (``├──``, ``└──``, ``│``) into
  the first column of a Rich table, with the other columns lining up
  as usual. When the tree has only the header column *and* it's the
  only report being shown, the bordered-table chrome is dropped and
  the tree renders as bare ASCII — the connectors already convey the
  hierarchy, and the box adds no information. Multi-column trees and
  multi-report outputs keep the chrome (there's no other way to line
  up siblings or distinguish reports from one another).
* ``tsv`` flattens the tree in pre-order into fixed-width rows. Column
  one always carries the node's own header-column value (the leaf), so
  ``awk '{print $1}'`` yields the node name regardless of depth.
  Columns two onwards carry the full root-to-node path, one component
  per cell, left-packed and padded on the right with empty cells so
  every row has the same number of path cells. The leaf therefore also
  appears as the last non-empty path cell — intentional duplication
  that keeps the row human-readable as a full path while giving
  scripts a fixed leaf column. Path columns are labelled ``Path1``,
  ``Path2``, … in 1-based style so that ``PathK`` is "the node at
  depth K" (root = depth 1); the largest ``PathN`` in the header row
  reveals the tree's maximum visible depth. Non-header data columns
  follow the path cells with their usual labels.
* ``json`` emits a nested ``{"values": {...}, "children": [...]}``
  structure under a ``"roots"`` list, with ``metadata.kind = "tree"``
  distinguishing it from table-shaped output.


.. _scalar-content:

Scalar content
--------------

Some commands produce just a single value — a name, a number, an
address, a status string. Wrapping that in a transposed 1×1 table
reads as ceremony around a single cell, and the JSON output ends up
with ``"rows": [{"load": "00001900"}]`` where the consumer really
just wants ``"value": "00001900"``. Use :class:`~asyoulikeit.ScalarContent`
instead:

.. code-block:: python

   from asyoulikeit import (
       Report, Reports, ScalarContent, report_output,
   )

   @click.command()
   @report_output
   @click.argument("image")
   def disc_title(image):
       return Reports(title=Report(data=ScalarContent(
           value=_read_title(image),
           title="Disc title",
       )))

The three formatters render scalars differently, following what each
format's consumer actually wants:

* ``display`` emits ``Title: value`` on a single line when a title is
  set (``value`` alone otherwise), and the description — if any —
  dim/italic on the line below.
* ``tsv`` emits **just the raw value** by default. The dominant pipe
  use case (``disc title image | pbcopy``) wants the answer, not a
  commented label.
* ``json`` emits the usual ``metadata`` / ``value`` shape, with
  ``metadata.kind = "scalar"``. Consumers can read
  ``.reports.title.value`` via ``jq`` and get exactly what they want.

Header resolution for scalars (and every other content kind) is
three-tier: the explicit CLI ``--header`` / ``--no-header`` wins if
given; otherwise ``Report.header`` is consulted; otherwise the
formatter picks a per-content default. TSV's default for scalars is
``header=False`` (bare value); display's is ``True`` (labelled, if a
title is set). To force the labelled TSV form ``# Title\nvalue``,
pass ``header=True`` on the :class:`~asyoulikeit.Report`, or
``--header`` on the CLI.


Transposition
-------------

Sometimes a table reads better flipped: columns of values paired with
a label column on the left rather than a header row on top. Set
``present_transposed=True`` on ``TableContent`` and the ``display`` and
``tsv`` formatters will rotate the data at render time. JSON is
unaffected — it's a structural format, not a visual one, and surfaces
the intent via a ``metadata.present_transposed`` flag instead.


Styling
-------

The ``display`` formatter supports per-cell styling (foreground colour,
background colour, bold, italic). Attach a second ``TableContent`` to
your ``Report`` via the ``styles`` argument, with the same shape as the
data table but cell values as dictionaries keyed by
:data:`~asyoulikeit.STYLE_FOREGROUND_COLOR`,
:data:`~asyoulikeit.STYLE_BOLD`, and so on. TSV and JSON ignore styles;
display applies them via Rich.


Custom formatters
-----------------

The built-in ``display``, ``tsv``, and ``json`` formatters are
stevedore-loaded entry points under the ``asyoulikeit.formatter``
namespace. Third-party packages (or your own consumer project) can
register additional formatters the same way:

.. code-block:: toml

   # in the consumer's pyproject.toml
   [project.entry-points."asyoulikeit.formatter"]
   xml = "mypackage.xml_formatter:Formatter"

Subclass :class:`~asyoulikeit.Formatter` and implement the single
``format(reports) -> str`` method. After ``pip install`` / ``uv sync``
of the registering package, the new format name appears automatically
in the ``--as`` choices of every command decorated with
``@report_output``.


Declaring reports
-----------------

A CLI built with ``@report_output`` accepts ``--report <name>`` but
users have no way to discover which names are valid — ``--help`` shows
the flag, not its domain. You can declare the set explicitly by passing
a ``reports=`` mapping of ``name → description`` to ``@report_output``:

.. code-block:: python

   from asyoulikeit import report_output, Report, Reports, TableContent

   @click.command()
   @report_output(reports={
       "summary":   "Site-wide totals",
       "courses":   "Per-course breakdown",
       "structure": "Module and section hierarchy",
   })
   def video_audit():
       """Audit the video library."""
       return Reports(
           summary=Report(data=...),
           courses=Report(data=...),
           structure=Report(data=...),
       )

Declaring ``reports=`` opts the command into four behaviours:

- **Decoration-time validation.** Non-identifier keys, non-string
  descriptions, and ``default_reports`` entries that refer to an
  undeclared name all raise :exc:`~asyoulikeit.ReportDeclarationError`
  at import time, not at first invocation.
- **Auto-documented** ``--help``. A ``Produces reports:`` block is
  appended to the command's help text, listing each declared name with
  its description.
- **Parse-time validation on** ``--report``. When the declaration is
  fully static, ``--report`` becomes a ``click.Choice`` — typos fail at
  parse with Click's list of valid values.
- **Runtime drift detection.** If the handler returns a
  :class:`~asyoulikeit.Reports` whose keys don't match the declaration
  (and no ``Ellipsis`` slot was declared, see below),
  :exc:`~asyoulikeit.ReportDeclarationError` is raised — catching the
  refactor-renamed-a-report-silently bug.

Dynamic report names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some commands produce one report per input — a map-style command whose
report names are known only at runtime. Use ``Ellipsis`` (``...``) as a
key to declare "this command also produces dynamically-named reports":

.. code-block:: python

   @report_output(reports={
       ...: "One report per input YAML file; name is the file stem.",
   })
   def validate(files):
       return Reports({f.stem: Report(data=...) for f in files})

Mixed declarations work too — a fixed set of known names *plus* a
dynamic tail:

.. code-block:: python

   @report_output(reports={
       "overall": "Global summary across all files",
       Ellipsis:  "One report per validated file; name is the file stem.",
   })
   def validate_all(files):
       ...

Dynamic commands skip the ``click.Choice`` step on ``--report`` (the
valid set isn't knowable at decoration time), but the rest of the
benefits — validation, help, drift detection on the static subset —
still apply.

Hyphens on the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python identifiers can't contain hyphens, but CLI convention strongly
prefers them. ``asyoulikeit`` normalises ``--report`` values
automatically: ``--report monthly-sales`` resolves to the declared
``monthly_sales`` report. The normalisation applies whether or not
``reports=`` is declared.

Discovering reports: ``list-reports`` and ``describe-report``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mirroring :ref:`formatter introspection <formatter-introspection>`,
asyoulikeit ships two ready-made command factories that the host CLI
drops into its group:

.. code-block:: python

   import click
   from asyoulikeit import (
       list_reports_command, describe_report_command,
   )

   @click.group()
   def cli(): ...

   cli.add_command(list_reports_command(),     name="list-reports")
   cli.add_command(describe_report_command(),  name="describe-report")

Both commands walk ``click.get_current_context().find_root()`` at
invoke time, so they find every command the host has registered
without per-command wiring. They are themselves ``@report_output``
commands, so they inherit ``--as / --report / --header / --detailed``
and render in any format:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mytool list-reports                       # full listing
   $ mytool list-reports video-audit           # one command
   $ mytool describe-report video-audit courses
   $ mytool describe-report video-audit '<dynamic>'   # describe the Ellipsis slot

Commands that don't declare ``reports=`` surface in ``list-reports``
with a single ``<undeclared>`` child, so authors can see which of
their commands haven't opted in yet.


.. _formatter-introspection:

Formatter introspection
-----------------------

Any CLI that lets users pass ``--as <format>`` eventually wants to
answer "which values are legal, and what does each one do?" asyoulikeit
exposes a primitive plus two command factories for exactly that.

The primitive :func:`~asyoulikeit.describe_formatter` reads the
formatter class's docstring (cleaned via :func:`inspect.cleandoc`,
without instantiating the class):

.. code-block:: python

   from asyoulikeit import describe_formatter, formatter_names

   for name in formatter_names():
       print(name, "—", describe_formatter(name, single_line=True))

Built on that primitive are two Click command factories,
:func:`~asyoulikeit.list_formatters_command` and
:func:`~asyoulikeit.describe_formatter_command`. Each returns a fully
assembled :class:`click.Command` decorated with ``@report_output`` —
so the meta-commands render in every format asyoulikeit already
supports. The host CLI picks the displayed command name on
``add_command``:

.. code-block:: python

   import click
   from asyoulikeit import (
       list_formatters_command, describe_formatter_command,
   )

   @click.group()
   def cli():
       pass

   cli.add_command(list_formatters_command(), name="list-formatters")
   cli.add_command(describe_formatter_command(), name="describe-formatter")

The list command returns a
:class:`~asyoulikeit.TableContent` of ``Name`` + one-line
``Description`` rows; the describe command takes a ``NAME`` argument
(restricted via ``click.Choice`` to the currently-registered
formatters) and returns a :class:`~asyoulikeit.ScalarContent` whose
``value`` is the full cleaned docstring and whose ``title`` is the
formatter name. Both inherit ``--as / --report / --header /
--detailed``, so:

- ``cli list-formatters --as json | jq`` gives you a machine-readable
  catalogue;
- ``cli describe-formatter tsv`` (TTY) shows ``tsv: <description>``;
- ``cli describe-formatter tsv --as tsv`` pipes the bare description
  (headerless — the TSV default for :class:`~asyoulikeit.ScalarContent`).

The factories are functions (not module-level command instances)
deliberately: ``formatter_names()`` and the ``click.Choice`` over it
are evaluated at factory-call time, so any formatter registered via
entry point before the host CLI builds its group is picked up without
a restart.


.. _testing:

Testing commands that use ``@report_output``
--------------------------------------------

Click's :class:`click.testing.CliRunner` captures stdout into a string
buffer. That buffer's ``isatty()`` returns ``False``, so the smart
default for ``--as`` lands on ``tsv``. If the test has assertions
about TSV output that's fine — you don't need to do anything. But if
your assertions depend on ``display``-mode layout (Rich borders,
titles, colour, wrapped text) or ``json`` structure, the captured
buffer's default doesn't exercise that path.

Two ways to get the format you want in tests:

**Pin the format on each invocation.** Pass ``--as <format>``
explicitly to the command under test:

.. code-block:: python

   def test_my_command_renders_the_title(runner):
       result = runner.invoke(cli, ["my-command", "--as", "display", "input"])
       assert "My Title" in result.output   # only visible in display mode

This is the clearest option when a handful of tests care about format;
the intent is visible at the call site and each test remains self-
contained.

**Set the environment variable.** The decorator consults
``ASYOULIKEIT_FORMAT`` before falling back to the TTY check, so a
session-wide, conftest-wide, or even test-wide override is one
line away:

.. code-block:: python

   # conftest.py — force display mode for every test in the suite
   import os
   os.environ["ASYOULIKEIT_FORMAT"] = "display"

   # or per-test with pytest's monkeypatch fixture
   def test_display_layout(runner, monkeypatch):
       monkeypatch.setenv("ASYOULIKEIT_FORMAT", "display")
       result = runner.invoke(cli, ["my-command", "input"])
       assert "My Title" in result.output

Precedence: an explicit ``--as`` on the command line still wins over
``ASYOULIKEIT_FORMAT``, so individual tests can opt out of a
suite-wide default without interference. An invalid value in the env
var fails fast with a clear error rather than silently falling back,
so typos don't quietly change which rendering path a test exercises.
